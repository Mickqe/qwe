        <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
        <h3>ACT 1</h3>
        <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
        <h4><br>Two households, both alike in dignity
            <br>(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
            <br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
            <br>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
            <br>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
            <br>A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
            <br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
            <br>Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
            <br>The fearful passage of their death-marked love
            <br>And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
            <br>Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,
            <br>Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
            <br>The which, if you with patient ears attend,
            <br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mendp</h4>
        <br><h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place</h3>

        <h3>SAMPSON</h3>
        <h4>GREGORY, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</h4>
        <h3>GREGORY</h3>
        <h4>No, for then we should be colliers.</h4>
